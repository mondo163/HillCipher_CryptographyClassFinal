# Hill Cipher Cryptography Class Final
 
# Description
This repository contains the final project my partner Nick Slaughter and myself created to demonstrate
the Hill Cypher. The home page takes in either your cipher or plain text along with the key. The program
does have a key checker to make sure that entered key can be used since the Hill Cipher is dependent on 
the determinant of the key matrix. Once the user has entered information, the user can either encrypt or decrypt
their text. This will then take you to a seperate page that shows visually how the hill cipher is encrypting
or decrypting.

# Responsibilities
Nick Slaughter:
 * Create the home, encryption, and decryption views
 * Data bind the results and values to the views

Myself:
 * Create the Encryption and Decryption Algorithms
 * Create the determinant Algorithm to check the key matrix
